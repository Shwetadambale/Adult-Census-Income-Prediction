# Adult-Census-Income-Prediction
# Overview

The Adult Census Income Prediction project aims to predict whether an individual earns more than Rs.50,000 annually based on various demographic and socioeconomic attributes. This predictive modeling task is significant as it helps in understanding the factors contributing to higher incomes and aids in targeted policy-making, resource allocation, and social welfare initiatives.

# Data Description

The dataset comprises a range of attributes including age, education level, occupation, marital status, race, gender, work hours per week, and more. Each attribute serves as a potential feature in the predictive model, providing insights into income patterns.

# Project Goal

This end-to-end project is made as a part of data science internship for Ineuron.ai.

# Objective

The primary goal is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts whether an individual's income crosses the Rs 50,000 mark, leveraging the provided census data. The model will be trained on a segment of the dataset and assessed on a separate test set to gauge its predictive accuracy.

# Methodology :

1.Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, addressing missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing or scaling numerical features to prepare the data for modeling.

2.Feature Selection and Engineering: Identifying pertinent features and potentially creating new ones to enhance the model's predictive ability.

3.Model Selection: Exploring diverse machine learning algorithms .

4.Model Training and Evaluation: Training the chosen model on the training dataset and evaluating its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, confusion matrix , f1 score .

5.Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing the model's hyperparameters to further enhance its predictive performance.

# Expected Outcome

The project aims to produce a robust predictive model capable of accurately classifying whether an individual's income exceeds Rs 50,000 annually. Insights derived from the model can illuminate influential factors affecting income levels, guiding decisions in social policy, employment strategies, and targeted intervention programs.

# Installation

The Code is written in Python 3.9. If you don't have Python installed you can find it here. If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after cloning the repository:

pip install -r requirements.txt
